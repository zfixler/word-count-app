# Word Count App

This project was created with create-react-app in order to demonstrate the use of React Hooks in a simple interactive app.

## Features

The user can track the number of words typed within the given 15 seconds. Once the timer is running, the button is disabled. After the time runs out, the number of words is displayed and the option to restart appears.

### Technology

The main point of this little app is to demonstrate the use of React Hooks useState, useEffect, and useRef, as well as the creation of custom hooks.

### Attribution

This project was build during a React course taught by Bob Ziroll as part of the Scrimba Frontend Career Path program.
